# Introduction
Welcome to the Investing Algorithm Framework documentation! 

The framework allows you to leverage python to build complex bots to trade. 
The framework aims to implement orders, position, trades and portfolio management. Also, the framework
aims to support multiple data sources, exchanges and brokers. Next to that backtesting and live trading is supported.

## Getting Started
The Investing Algorithm Framework is a Python framework for developing and backtesting investing algorithms.

You might also want to check the [quick start guide](/blog/how-to-create-a-trading-bot-in-5-steps) directly which 
outlines the fundamentals of creating a simple trading bot.

After that, you can read the [basics](/docs/Getting%20Started/application-setup.md) to learn more about the framework.

## What you'll need
- [python 3.10 or higher](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Installation
You can install the framework using the following command:

```bash
pip install investing-algorithm-framework
```
